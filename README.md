About this repository
=====================

This repository is a mirror of the [source code projects provided by Google][1]. This repository will **keep track of updated versions** of these sample projects. This will allow anyone to find out **what has changed** without much effort.

Each project contains the `README.md` with the **original description of the specific project**. There is also a link to the **original source** of the project at the end of each `README.md`.


Contribution
------------

Feel free to send pull requests if you find out about updates to the sample before I do ...
Please mind that you might need to update the `.gitignore` file to exclude noise contained in the `.zip` archives.
